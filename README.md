- 👋 Hi, I’m @ACS-Web-X (The 1st Chess Intelligence Programming Language). This Chessware is Object-oriented and Data-driven (Infinite Chess Data, Geo-Data, AlphaNum Data, MultiaLingual Data, and perhaps etc. Data). My motto is Less Codes! More Actions!
- 👀 I’m interested in proliferating my recently invented Chess-driven Ai Software ( Most especially, the GENESIS111 Chessware). Right here on GitHub, I will like to work with some Scripters to develop a Plugin for a mobile/web gadgets ~ by integrating the ACS-Web-X Program into some existing Scripts like HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and perhaps etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about how to integrate ACS-Web-X into MORE existing Programming Languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the global proliferation of the ACS-Web-X Program.
