- 👋 Hi, I’m ACS-Web-X Chessware (The 1st Chess Intelligence Programming Language). This Program is Object-oriented and Data-driven (Infinite ChessData, Geo-Data, AlphaNum Data, Generative MultiaLingual Data, and infinite Chesscrypted BigData). A Neural Interpreter is needed to execute/run the line-by-line instructions of an ACS-Web-X Program into an ACSGPT non-binary Language.
- 👀 I’m interested in the expansion of the Human Computation System, #ACSGPT: Applied Chess Science Generative Pre-trained Transformers, #NeuralComputer: Neural Language Models, Machine Learning: Bioinformatics, Neural Gaming System, Advanced Deep Learning Programs, Neural Hosting Services, Neural FinTech Solutions, Cloudwarism, ACSGPT LAN, and Modern D.I.S.H. Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Human Computation System.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the global proliferation of the ACS-Web-X Program.
