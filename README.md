- 👋 Hi, I’m ACS-Web-X Chessware (The 1st Chess Intelligence Programming Language). This Program is Object-oriented and Data-driven (Infinite ChessData, Geo-Data, AlphaNum Data, Generative MultiaLingual Data, and infinite Chesscrypted BigData).
- 👀 I’m interested in the expansion of the #ACSGPT: Applied Chess Science Generative Pre-trained Transformers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about how to integrate ACS-Web-X Chessware and its Ai-Cloudware into MORE existing Programming Languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the global proliferation of the ACS-Web-X Program.
