- 👋 Hi, I’m @ACS-Web-X (The 1st Chess Intelligence Programming Language). This Chessware is Object-oriented and data-driven.
- 👀 I’m interested in proliferating my recently invented Chess-driven Ai Software ( Most especially, the GENESIS111 Chessware).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about how to integrate ACS-Web-X into some existing Programming Languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the global proliferation of the ACS-Web-X Program.
