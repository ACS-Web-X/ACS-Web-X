- 👋 Hi, I’m @ACS-Web-X (The 1st Chess Intelligence Programming Language). This Chessware is Object-oriented and Data-driven (Infinite Chess Data, Geo-Data, AlphaNum Data, MultiaLingual Data, and perhaps etc. BigData). My motto is; Less Codes! More Actions! 
- 👀 I’m interested in proliferating my recently invented Chess-driven Ai Software (Most especially, the GENESIS111 Chessware). Right here on GitHub, I will like to work with some Scripters to develop a Plugin for some mobile/web gadgets ~ by integrating the ACS-Web-X Program into some existing Scripts, like; HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and perhaps etc. Here's a convincing MOVE to hint Netizens about the viability of this Chess-Knight-Horse-Logod App!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about how to integrate ACS-Web-X into MORE existing Programming Languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the global proliferation of the ACS-Web-X Program.
